Easylearn is designed for machine learning mainly in resting-state fMRI, radiomics and other fields (such as EEG). Easylearn is built on top of scikit-learn, pytorch and other packages. Easylearn can assist doctors and researchers who have limited coding experience to easily realize machine learning, e.g., (MR/CT/PET/EEG)imaging-marker- or other biomarker-based disease diagnosis and prediction, treatment response prediction, disease subtyping, dimensional decoding for transdiagnostic psychiatric diseases or other diseases, disease mechanism exploration and etc.  

We focus on machine learning rather than data preprocessing. Many software, such as SPM, GRETNA, DPABI, REST, RESTPlus, CCS, FSL, Freesufer, nipy, nipype, nibabel, fmriprep and etc, can be used for data preprocessing.

# History
- version 1.0.28: Updated binomial test
- version 1.0.29: Fixed error when generating targets
> When the input target is a int, eslearn will automatically generate __ID__(np.arange(0,len(nFiles))).
- version 1.0.30: Added EEGClassifier which is a deep learning machine learning
- version 1.1.2 Fixed EEGClassifier history problem
- version 1.1.7 Fixed only one item in list feature_applied_mask problem


# New features in the next version
- Add evaluation method in the model_evaluation module for multiple-class classification
